An advanced beginner programmer who is always curious about making something...

üî≠ I'm currently developing a PocketMine-MP and PowerNukkitX plugin. Additionally, I often do something quirky for my repositories.

üìñ Currently learning JavaScript, PHP, Java, and C++

<br>

### Languages, Tools, and Frameworks

  - **PHP**: Often used as a backend server and for APIs in applications. Also creating plugins for PocketMine-MP.
  - **ReactJS**: My favorite web framework for frontend development.
  - **NextJS**: My secondary backend framework.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: My current CSS styling framework for ReactJS projects.
  - **JavaScript**: I wonder what I can create...
  - **VS Code**: My default IDE for JSON UI and Java projects.
  - **Cursor**: My favorite IDE for all projects.
  - **C++**: Used for Arduino projects and OOP.
  - **C#**: used for Windows Form App.
  - **Java**: Used for developing PowerNukkitX plugins.
  - **Python**: Snek üêç.

<br>

### Other stuff

  - **Windows**: My main operating system. I use Windows 11.
  - **Linux**: My servers are running Linux. Even my IOT device. I prefer to use Ubuntu since it's easy to use.
  - **IndiHome**: My shitty Internet provider. Really! You can't get another provider if you live in a remote city.
  - **[Herza](https://herza.id/)**: My projects will be hosted on Herza. Previously, I used this as my proxy to reduce a latency from Indonesia to OVHCloud (Singapore).
  - **Orange Pi Zero**: My IOT Device.

### My Projects

  - **FARDS (Private)**: Fast and responsive defense system. Used to catch cheaters.
  - **RGI-AntiProxy (Private)**: A PocketMine-MP plugin to block players for using a proxy/VPN.
  - **RGI-AntiSpamNX (Private)**: A PowerNukkitX plugin to filter, block, and even kick out players for spamming. Also, this is my first plugin I create from Java.
  - **RGI-ServerForm (Private)**: A [Venity Network](https://venitymc.com/) resource pack for custom server forms and other stuff.
  - **[RGI-Telerage](https://github.com/RedStoneCraftGG/RGI-Telerage)**: A silly project that used to spam a Telegram bot from a scammer.
  - **[Crosshair XYZ](https://github.com/RedStoneCraftGG/MCBE-Crosshair-XYZ)**: My abandoned project for Minecraft Bedrock texture, but I manage to revive it and publish it as open source code.
  - **Lethal Company Silly Mod**: You can find it [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/MAGDONAL/GanjarHoardingBugSound/). And unreleased mod preview [here](https://youtu.be/3B7hUDU_seg). Mostly are discontinued.
